Description: Constrained Kernel-based methods of modelling and predicting space-time hierarchical models. This package interacts with bio and associated projects to provide some kernel-density like (global covariate modelling - local space-time windowed) modelling and interpolation methods. Constrainst are in the form of covariates and/or local process models.
